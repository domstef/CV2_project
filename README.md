# Image manipulation with opencv
This is a fun project for image processing and analysis course. This application can be used to change certain features (like contrast or saturation) of an image and make common morphological operators like erosion and dilation. Project is written in Python and uses libraries like openCV and Qt.
Comments and the application itself are written in Polish, because it was a project for an University Course.
